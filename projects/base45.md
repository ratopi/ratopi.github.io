During the corona pandemic a new encoding enters the light of the world.
Health and vaccination certificates in the EU are encoded in *base45*, optimized for text representation in QR-codes.

I couldn't resist and wrote an encoder in pure Erlang.

It's available via <a href="https://hex.pm/packages/base45">Hex.pm</a>.
Source code is on <a href="https://github.com/ratopi/base45">github</a>.
