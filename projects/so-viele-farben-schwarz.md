„So viele Farben Schwarz“ (“So many colours black”) was a sound installation for the Fluxus-Happening
[“Neunstundengeburtstagshappening”](http://www.zeitraumexit.de/veranstaltung/happy-birthday-fluxus)
at [Zeitraumexit](http://www.zeitraumexit.de/) together with Frank Rossi.

Frank developed a really amazing idea for a sound installation, and asked me for supporting him at the IT-side
of the project.

Technology stack was

* Arduino with ultrasonic distance detectors and MIDI-interface
* MIDI-Sampler
* A lot of vintage stuff ...
