Just released Version 2.0.0 of my base45 library in pure Erlang.

Base45 is the encoding used in QR-Codes for health and vaccination certificates in the EU.

To include base45 to your project just add the dependency to your rebar.config:

	{deps, [base45]}.

I would be happy to hear from you if it is useful for your project.
