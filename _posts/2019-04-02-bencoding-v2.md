Just released Version 0.2 of my Bencoding library in pure Erlang.

Bencoding helps you to read and write files encoded in bittorent encoding format.

Version 0.2 introduces some small optimization in decoding.

To include bencoding to your project just add the dependency to your rebar.config:

	{deps, [bencoding]}.


Let me hear from you, if it is useful for you project!
