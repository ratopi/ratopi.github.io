Just released Version 1.0 of my Bencoding library in pure Erlang.
Bencoding is now ready for the use in productive systems.

Bencoding helps you to read and write files encoded in bittorent encoding format.
 
To include bencoding to your project just add the dependency to your rebar.config:

	{deps, [bencoding]}.

Let me hear from you, if it is useful for you project!
